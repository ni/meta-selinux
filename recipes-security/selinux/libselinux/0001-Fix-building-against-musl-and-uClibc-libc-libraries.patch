Subject: [PATCH] Fix building against musl and uClibc libc libraries.

Currently, the src/Makefile provides the FTS_LDLIBS when building against musl
or uClibc. However, this is missing from utils/Makefile, which causes linking
to fail.

Add the FTS_LDLIBS variable to the LDLIBS variable in utils/Makefile to fix
compiling against uClibc and musl.
